This is a utility for flashing ROMs to the EZF Advance flash cart for the
Game Boy Advance using a Nintendo DS. This model of flash cart comes with a
USB cable to plug the GBA into a computer, and uses the cable to flash the
cart, but I was given this cart without a cable, so I had to make due without
the cable. I couldn't find any existing software for flashing this cart, so I
wrote my own.

It is only tested with one EZF Advance Realtime cartridge, and is unlikely to
work with any other model without modifications. It may work fine on the
EZF Advance (non-Realtime) model, but that's likely it.

This is a very basic utility and requires the ROM to be called rom.gba and for
it to be placed at the root of the filesystem on your DLDI-compatible DS flash
cart. While I have tested this with my configuration, I can't guarantee this
won't break your flash cart, so use at your own risk. It does not flash the
ROM loader/selector that comes on the cart or is loaded by the official
software. Whatever one ROM you flash is the only thing you'll have on the cart
after flashing it. Furthermore, flashing to the cart too many times may damage
the early sectors on the cart and render it unusable, so don't flash too much.

As always, this wasn't created to promote piracy. Rather, I wrote this to
flash some testing utilities and homebrew that I'd written. I can't stop you
from using this for piracy, but that wasn't why I wrote this.

You are welcome to use, abuse, or do whatever you want with the provided
source code. I don't care about attribution; it took me less than three days
to reverse engineer the EZF Advance software and write this software, anyway.
